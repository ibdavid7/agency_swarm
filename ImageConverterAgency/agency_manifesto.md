# ImageConverterAgency Manifesto

The mission of the ImageConverterAgency is to provide a seamless and efficient way to convert .webp images into .png format. The agency will consist of agents that handle image processing and coordination. Each agent will function autonomously yet collaborate to achieve the common goal of image conversion.

## Goals
1. Convert .webp images to .png format efficiently.
2. Ensure high-quality output images.
3. Provide a user-friendly interface for image conversion.

## Working Environment
The agents will operate in a Python environment, utilizing libraries such as PIL (Python Imaging Library) for image processing. The communication between agents will be synchronous, ensuring a smooth workflow and coordination.
